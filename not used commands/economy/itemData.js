                    "body":"\"Hey Evan?\" Jared asked one afternoon.\"Yeah?\"\"Do you ever think about what would happen if you ate a bathbomb?\"\"...What the hell.\"\"Just...imagine it.Your stomach foaming up into colors. The cronch of it. The taste of...wait, what would a bathbomb even taste like?\"\"I don't know. Wouldn't it be hard, though?\"\"Hard?\"\"I mean, it'd be bad for you, right?\"\"Bad?\"\"If you say 'kinky' next, I'm done with you.\"\"Kinky!\"\"Seriously though, don't try it. Don't eat a bathbomb\"\"Don't tell me what to do!\" Jared screamed. \"I didn't tell you what to do. I told you what not to do.\"\"Whatever! Same thing!\"\"If you wanna go eat a bathbomb, fine. Just don't say I didn't warn you.\"That night, Evan got an email from Jared saying that he had eaten a bathbomb. When Evan asked him why, Jared's only response was, \"THE CRONCH WAS SO GOOD. I LOVE THE CRONCH.\"Evan immediately looked up whether or not bathbombs were toxic.",
                    "body2": "The first article he found was called \"Are Bath Bombs Safe? How to Avoid Harmful Ingredients\". It detailed all the dangerous chemicals that could be found in bathbombs - the dyes, the fragrance, almost every part of it had some sort of toxic-sounding, hard-to-pronounce substance in it. Phrases like \"linked to cancer\", \"human carcinogen\", and \"hormone disruption\" began to worry him. Furthermore, the article noted that glitter was found in a lot of bathbombs.&nbsp;With a sinking feeling in the bottom of his chest, Evan looked up \"What would happen if you ate glitter\".",
                    "body3": "The first result, which popped up right away, said that it if you ate a packet of glitter, you would feel sick.&nbsp;Worried, he immediately searched \"if your friend eats a bathbomb should you call 911\". The first result was an article about a dog who ate a bathbomb and got rushed to the emergency vet after vomiting and later lost consciousness.",
                    "body4": "Evan wasn't sure if humans would have the same reaction, so he asked his mom, \"What would happen if you ate a bathbomb?\"Evan's mom looked at him, puzzled. \"Why do you need to know this?\"\"...Because Jared ate a bathbomb.\"It was clear by the look on her face that she wanted to say, \"I think you need smarter friends\", but what she really said was \"I don't know, but tell him to call the hospital if he starts feeling sick\".Evan went back onto his computer and sent an email to Jared, saying that he should call the hospital for having eaten a bathbomb.",
                    "body5": "\"I ATE MORE THAN JUST ONE NOW! I LOVED THE CRONCH SO I ATE SEVEN MORE! My stomach hurts a lot but it's worth it for the CRONCH!\"Evan picked up his phone and dialed 911.&nbsp;\"Hello, this is 911, what is your emergency?\"\"...My friend's eaten a total of eight bathbombs in the last hour and I'm worried about him.\"\"Understood. How old is he?\"\"He's 18.\"There was a long, awkward pause. \"We'll send someone right away.\""
